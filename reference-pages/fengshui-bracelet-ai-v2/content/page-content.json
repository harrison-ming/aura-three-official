  "science_explanation": "It's not magic.\n\nIt's energy.\n\nAncient Chinese philosophers discovered that everything ‚Äî including humans ‚Äî vibrates at a specific frequency.\n\nWhen your energy is blocked or imbalanced, you attract:\n\n‚Ä¢ Bad luck\n‚Ä¢ Financial struggle\n‚Ä¢ Missed opportunities\n‚Ä¢ Constant setbacks\n\nThe FengShui Bracelet‚Ñ¢ works by:\n\n1. Clearing energy blockages that repel wealth\n2. Activating the \"luck frequency\" using volcanic obsidian (a powerful grounding stone)\n3. Channeling abundance through the Pixiu charm ‚Äî a mythical creature known for attracting and protecting wealth\n\nThink of it like this:\n\nYour energy is like a radio signal.\n\nWhen it's fuzzy or blocked, you can't tune into the \"wealth station.\"\n\nThe bracelet clears the static‚Ä¶ and suddenly, opportunities start flowing your way.",
