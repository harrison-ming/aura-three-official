## Science Section Title

Why Does This Bracelet Work?

---

## Science Explanation

It's not magic.

It's energy.

Ancient Chinese philosophers discovered that everything ‚Äî including humans ‚Äî vibrates at a specific frequency.

When your energy is blocked or imbalanced, you attract:

‚Ä¢ Bad luck
‚Ä¢ Financial struggle
‚Ä¢ Missed opportunities
‚Ä¢ Constant setbacks

The FengShui Bracelet‚Ñ¢ works by:

1. Clearing energy blockages that repel wealth
2. Activating the "luck frequency" using volcanic obsidian (a powerful grounding stone)
3. Channeling abundance through the Pixiu charm ‚Äî a mythical creature known for attracting and protecting wealth

Think of it like this:

Your energy is like a radio signal.

When it's fuzzy or blocked, you can't tune into the "wealth station."

The bracelet clears the static‚Ä¶ and suddenly, opportunities start flowing your way.
